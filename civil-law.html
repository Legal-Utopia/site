                <h2>Civil Law</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="container" style="padding-top: 50px">
        <p>Civil Law is an extensive area concerning issues and disputes between private citizens. 
            In this instance, this area includes disputes concerning private and commercial transactions 
            between private citizens, as well as the protection and enforcement of rights of private citizens.
            The civil courts hold powers which are used to resolve and enforce these disputes and individual rights;
            for instance, the issuance of debt orders, bankruptcy petitions,
            restraining orders, charging orders, money claims and enforcement orders.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Here is what Civil Law covers:</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>Bankruptcy is a legal process imposed by a court order, and normally initiated 
            by a debtor who cannot afford to pay their creditors. 
            By declaring bankruptcy, creditors are barred from seeking the repayment
            of their funds from the bankrupt individual, and most debts are dissolved 
            after expiry of a statutory time limit. There are both advantages and disadvantages 
            to declaring bankruptcy, with serious financial and legal consequences to consider. </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Civil Claim</h3>
        <p>A Civil Claim is a formal claim made by an applicant between individuals 
            or individuals and the state. The applicant can address the complaint in a civil court,
            and can seek remedies, injunctions, 
            sanctions and other forms of relief if they meet certain thresholds and conditions.
            Generally, civil claims are used to retrieve assets,
            compensation or enforce personal or contractual rights. </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Civil Procedure</h3>
        <p>Civil Procedure is detailed in the Civil Procedure Rules
            which is a framework used by courts and parties to disputes when making
            or dealing with a civil claim. The Rules concern matters such as time constraints,
            the way evidence should be handled and produced, 
            the variety of orders available to apply for,
            and sanctions for non-compliance of rules and orders. </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Court Enforcement</h3>
        <p>When a party refuses or fails to comply with a court order made against them,
            the court may put in place a further order or authorise court
            enforcement agents to enforce the active court order made. 
            This includes, for instance, allowing enforcement agents to remove
            persons from land or property, as well as the collection or removal
            of funds or assets to satisfy a debt.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Interim Charging Order</h3>
        <p>An Interim Charging Order is a court order which allows a
            creditor to secure his debt against the debtor's property. 
            This is made in the interim, if the court are satisfied that 
            the debtor has a share or full ownership of the property in question.
            Interim orders can be made without notice, and once obtained, the creditor 
            can register it against the debtor's property, prohibiting the sale of it
            until the court has made a final order. 
            If a final order is made, the creditor could force the sale of the 
            debtor's property to retrieve what is owed to them if certain 
            conditions are met.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Restraining Order</h3>
        <p>A Restraining order is an order put in place by the 
            court which prevents an individual from contacting or visiting the applicant. 
            This type of order can be put in place against an individual for a number of reasons.
            While the individual has a right to appeal the court's decision, 
            if breached, there are serious consequences, including loss of child custody,
            being held in contempt of court, fines and imprisonment.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Third Party Debt Order</h3>
        <p>A Third Party Debt Order is a court order which permits a creditor
            to take what is owed to them directly from a third party who holds the debtors funds;
            rather than waiting for the debtor to transfer the same to them. 
            The creditor will need to demonstrate that the debtor has the funds available to pay the creditor,
            but that they are held by a third party (such as a bank or employer).</p>

                                The court may require the Defendant to pay a 
                                fine or have their assets confiscated as a result of their
                                non-compliance. They can also be imprisoned for a
                                maximum period of 2 years. The court also has 
                                other punishable orders available to it.

                                An injunction can be made in the interim while the case is progressing at court.
                                This will require the Defendant to do or not do something during the case proceedings.
                                An injunction order can be ‘final’ if the order is made at the end of the proceedings.

                                The interim third debt order will require the third party to hold on to the

                                the final order is made. Usually 28 days after the interim third party debt order,
                                the final order will be made. 
                                The final order will be made at the final hearing if,

                                the ways in which they can attempt to resolve the issue.

                                Mediation is not legally binding and is confidential. 
                                Arbitration is where an arbitrator decides on how the dispute
                                should be resolved after hearing submissions from the Claimant 
                                and the Defendant. Early neutral evaluation is where an independent

                                weaknesses of the Claimant and the Defendant’s case. 
                                The Claimant and Defendant can use this assessment to
