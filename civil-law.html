                <h2>Civil Law</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="container" style="padding-top: 50px">
        <p>Civil Law is an extensive area concerning issues and disputes between private citizens. 
            In this instance, this area includes disputes concerning private and commercial transactions 
            between private citizens, as well as the protection and enforcement of rights of private citizens.
            The civil courts hold powers which are used to resolve and enforce these disputes and individual rights;
            for instance, the issuance of debt orders, bankruptcy petitions,
            restraining orders, charging orders, money claims and enforcement orders.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Here is what Civil Law covers:</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>Bankruptcy is a legal process imposed by a court order, and normally initiated 
            by a debtor who cannot afford to pay their creditors. 
            By declaring bankruptcy, creditors are barred from seeking the repayment
            of their funds from the bankrupt individual, and most debts are dissolved 
            after expiry of a statutory time limit. There are both advantages and disadvantages 
            to declaring bankruptcy, with serious financial and legal consequences to consider. </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Civil Claim</h3>
        <p>A Civil Claim is a formal claim made by an applicant between individuals 
            or individuals and the state. The applicant can address the complaint in a civil court,
            and can seek remedies, injunctions, 
            sanctions and other forms of relief if they meet certain thresholds and conditions.
            Generally, civil claims are used to retrieve assets,
            compensation or enforce personal or contractual rights. </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Civil Procedure</h3>
        <p>Civil Procedure is detailed in the Civil Procedure Rules
            which is a framework used by courts and parties to disputes when making
            or dealing with a civil claim. The Rules concern matters such as time constraints,
            the way evidence should be handled and produced, 
            the variety of orders available to apply for,
            and sanctions for non-compliance of rules and orders. </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Court Enforcement</h3>
        <p>When a party refuses or fails to comply with a court order made against them,
            the court may put in place a further order or authorise court
            enforcement agents to enforce the active court order made. 
            This includes, for instance, allowing enforcement agents to remove
            persons from land or property, as well as the collection or removal
            of funds or assets to satisfy a debt.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Interim Charging Order</h3>
        <p>An Interim Charging Order is a court order which allows a
            creditor to secure his debt against the debtor's property. 
            This is made in the interim, if the court are satisfied that 
            the debtor has a share or full ownership of the property in question.
            Interim orders can be made without notice, and once obtained, the creditor 
            can register it against the debtor's property, prohibiting the sale of it
            until the court has made a final order. 
            If a final order is made, the creditor could force the sale of the 
            debtor's property to retrieve what is owed to them if certain 
            conditions are met.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Restraining Order</h3>
        <p>A Restraining order is an order put in place by the 
            court which prevents an individual from contacting or visiting the applicant. 
            This type of order can be put in place against an individual for a number of reasons.
            While the individual has a right to appeal the court's decision, 
            if breached, there are serious consequences, including loss of child custody,
            being held in contempt of court, fines and imprisonment.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding:15px"></div>

    <div class="container" style="padding: 25px">
        <h3>Third Party Debt Order</h3>
        <p>A Third Party Debt Order is a court order which permits a creditor
            to take what is owed to them directly from a third party who holds the debtors funds;
            rather than waiting for the debtor to transfer the same to them. 
            The creditor will need to demonstrate that the debtor has the funds available to pay the creditor,
            but that they are held by a third party (such as a bank or employer).</p>

                                The court may require the Defendant to pay a 
                                fine or have their assets confiscated as a result of their
                                non-compliance. They can also be imprisoned for a
                                maximum period of 2 years. The court also has 
                                other punishable orders available to it.

                                Prohibitory injunctions require the Defendant not to do something.
                                An injunction can be made in the interim while the case is progressing at court.

                                the final order will be made.

                                Mediation is not legally binding and is confidential. 
                                Arbitration is where an arbitrator decides on how the dispute
                                should be resolved after hearing submissions from the Claimant 
                                and the Defendant. Early neutral evaluation is where an independent

                                weaknesses of the Claimant and the Defendant’s case.

                                    The second is partly admitting to the claim. 
                                    This will be where the Defendant admits that they 
                                    owe money or other compensation to the Claimant but not the full amount claimed.
                                    The third is defending the claim. 
                                    This is where the Defendant denies that they owe money to the Claimant. 
                                    The Defendant could also include a Counterclaim within their Defence. 
                                    The Counterclaim will be a claim against the Claimant for money or other compensation.

                                    civil case however the stages will vary depending on the case.
                                    The Claimants and the Defendants can make applications during 
                                    the proceedings which can add more stages to the proceedings. 
                                    The first stage is the pre-action conduct and protocol stage 
                                    where the Claimant and the Defendant try to resolve the dispute outside of court through
                                    negotiation and possibly alternative dispute resolutions.
                                    The second stage is the issuing the claim and exchanging statements of case stage where 
                                    the Claimant will file and serve their Claim Form and their Particulars of Claim and the 
                                    Defendant will file and serve their Acknowledgement of Service and Defence.
                                    The third stage is exchange of evidence where the case will be allocated
                                    to the appropriate track and Claimant and Defendant
                                    will disclose relevant documents and exchange witness statements.
                                    The fourth stage is where the case will go into trial where the court will hear the submissions,
                                    witness evidence and expert evidence and make a judgment.
                                    The fifth stage is the post trial stage where the parties can enforce the judgment if the judgment 
                                    was made in their favour and the parties can appeal the decision.
