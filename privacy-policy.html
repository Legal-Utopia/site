            ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This

        <p class="font_8"><span class="color_15">13.2 All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to
            the email or postal addresses shown in Part 15. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access

            is the easiest way to tell us everything we&nbsp;need to know to respond to your request as quickly as

            calendar month and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we&nbsp;aim to provide a
            complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however,
            particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from
