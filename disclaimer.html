        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our contract review service is intended to be utilised
            as an on-demand support tool to assist a user in identifying a limited
            range of key or important clauses in a limited range of legal documents,
            contracts of insurance, or policy documents. </p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">This service seeks to autonomously (without humans) scan a
            legal document that you upload or otherwise make available to
            Our system and label (with respect to the type of legal document it is).
            In doing this, We utilise Artificial Intelligence Technologies to
            locate clauses within the legal document based on the type of legal
            document you have made available. This is informed by a process
            We have developed based on information gathered by Us and third
            parties engaged by Us of similar or alike legal documents of that type. </p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">This service may not be trained or proficient in your type
            of legal document that you make available to Our system, nor will Our
            Artificial Intelligence Technologies or process necessarily be able to
            identify or locate any clauses within any legal document type made available to it.
            If you make available to Our system a legal document that is
            within the scope of training or proficiency of Our
            Artificial Intelligence Technology, Our service may not be able to
            authoritatively assess, extract, classify or convert clauses within
            said legal document or produce an expected output.This is due to the
            use and limitation of Our Artificial Intelligence Technology
            and its potential for proficiency to vary substantially
            (it operates through an assessment of probabilities) and may
            still fail to assess, extract, classify or convert clauses
            with any degree of certainty. </p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">This service will always seek the users’ upload of a legal
            document and shall rely on the users’ input of the document type, which
            shall be used to inform the process that the Artificial Intelligence will follow.
            It is therefore the users’ responsibility to upload the correct document
            type and correct document label.
        </p>

         <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">This service has been designed to be used by
            informed laypersons who are over the age of 18, resident in
            England and Wales with a legal document or file subject to the
            jurisdiction and laws of England and Wales only.
            It is intended to be used for informative educational
            and general information purposes.
        </p>

         <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">This service is not intended to be used for the purposes of,
            or in replacement of, professional legal advice or the services of
            regulated legal professionals. This service does not, and cannot,
            provide any definitive assessment or identification of the precise
            legal interpretation or meaning of any clauses within any legal documents,
            but that of a general assessment of clause variants.
        </p>

         <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Any “simple clause” conversions that are produced as a
            result of the use of this service are drafted on the basis of a
            collective interpretation of all clauses of that type or variant,
            including clauses of that legal document type that may be worded differently,
            of clauses within a limited range of training data.
            This forms the outer scope of the basis of the interpretation of
            any one clause and its subsequent “simple” wording conversion or
            explanation of meaning.

            coronavirus-related legislation and statutory instruments of the UK Parliament,
            Welsh Assembly, or relevant Secretary of State in the jurisdiction of
            England and Wales only.

         <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">It should be recognised that this field of legislation
            is at high-risk of becoming outdated, irrelevant, amended, appealed,
            revoked, or otherwise invalidated or varied by the relevant legislator,
            government official, or other such authorised persons.
            It is, therefore, important to consider that the contents of this
            service should not be solely relied upon for the purposes of any legal issue,
            problem, circumstance, rights, proceedings, or any other form of
            formal or informal legal proceedings.
