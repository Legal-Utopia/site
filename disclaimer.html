        <p class="font_7"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Intended Use (Our Services):</span></p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services are intended to be utilised as a self-help tool to guide a user in relation to a
          limited range of legal problems and disputes in England and Wales. Our Services seek to collect user
          information by displaying a variety of options, questions, and asking the user to explain or describe their
          legal issue or dispute; the questions and options during the assessment process is based on information
          gathered by Legal Utopia and third parties engaged by Us, informed by reviewing similar experiences of
          historical legal issues or disputes of a similar or the same type.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services may provide text-based Legal Guidance content; this content has been generated
          and/or reviewed by third parties engaged by Us and deemed to be reputable legal services providers located in
          the United Kingdom. This Legal Guidance content is the copyright content of such third parties and not
          Us.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services provides a user with a general assessment of the classification of their legal
          issue or dispute by leveraging Artificial Intelligence Technology; and general Legal Guidance in relation to a
          particular field and subfield of English law based on your interaction with Our triage system. This general
          assessment provides limited, text-based Legal Guidance content only.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services may not be able to authoritatively assess and classify your explanation or
          description of your legal issue or dispute precisely, this is due to the use and limitation of Our Artificial
          Intelligence Technology, which may not be aware of; or proficient in, your legal issue or dispute. Where the
          Artificial Intelligence Technology used is proficient in a particular legal issue or dispute,
          its&nbsp;proficiency may vary substantially (it operates through the assessment of probabilities) and may
          still fail to classify your legal issue or dispute with any degree of certainty.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services may not be able to provide the relevant questions, options, or scenarios related
          to any users’ particular circumstances as Our triage system is not exhaustive. As such, this may prevent a
          user from being provided with one or more of the outputs otherwise expected, including but not limited to,
          legal service(s), portal(s), resource(s), and Legal Guidance content.</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services will always seek a users’ input to help guide the assessment and subsequent
          display of certain outputs. It is, therefore, the users’ responsibility to ensure that they input the correct
          responses to reflect their circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services have been designed to be used by informed laypersons who are over the age of 18,
          resident in England and Wales with a legal issue or dispute subject to the jurisdiction and laws of England
          and Wales only. It is intended to be used for general information purposes; and to encourage legal education
          of particular laws and rights in England and Wales only.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services are not intended to be used for the purposes of, or in replacement of,
          professional legal advice or the services of regulated legal professionals. Our Services do not provide any
          definitive assessment or identification of ground(s), merit(s), or the application of any individual or
          collective legal claim(s), proceeding(s), or right(s).&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7"><span class="wixGuard">​</span></p>

        <p class="font_7">Our Services, in addition to algorithmic predictions from free text, asks a series of
          questions that require the selection from a pick list of answers - the answers to those questions form the
          outer scope of the issues the system can analyse.</p>

        <p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="font_7">If Our Services do not return a result this is likely because your issue is outside the scope
          of the system or has been expressed in a way that the system has not encountered to date - as both of these
          scenarios may be outside the system capabilities generally we cannot assist further. Our Services are limited
          by scope to that identified in our <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a
              href="https://www.legalutopia.co.uk/terms-of-use-business" target="_self">Terms of Sale </a></span>and
          this disclaimer as we are not a law firm or legal adviser and are not in a position to individually evaluate
          any particular legal issue manually with better accuracy than the system.&nbsp;</p>
